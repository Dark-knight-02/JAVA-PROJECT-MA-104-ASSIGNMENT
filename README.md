## Academic Management System
### PROJECT EXPLANATION:
I have designed an academic management system to calculate the final mark output of students in an academy. I have also designed a bonus mark allocation to the students who have done something extra curricular in their academic session. The ones who have done something against the academyâ€™s agenda should also be punished so I have also allocated negative marks to those students. The final results are published considering all the activities of the students including the academic performance extra-curricular activities and also the negative marks for bad behaviour.

### Functions of class:
#### Abstract class Registration:
Defines the attributes that are needed for a candidate to register. Contains an abstract method which displays the information.

#### Class Student:
Inherits Registration. Contains additional attributes of professor name and roll number, which are things assigned after registration. Also, the `displayStudent()` method is defined here. A method
`assignProf()` helps to assign a professor based on the subject of student.

#### Class ExamProfile:
Inherits Student class. Contains information if the student is eligible for penalty or grace marks, and
also the test scores of the student. Also, the `showScore()` method displays the score.

#### Interface Achievement:
Contains the marks that are to be rewarded or deducted as grace/penalty.

#### Class Result:
Inherits Examprofile class and implements Achievement. It has a constructor to initiate the class, as well as a method calculatedResult() which calculates the marks based on the conditions. Also, method displayResult() displays the final result of the student.
When a new object is initiated, the constructor assigns the values to the attributes, most of which are inherited from other classes. The method `calculatedResult()` uses control statements to calculate the final marks of the student based on the attributes. The method `displayResult()` uses inherited methods `assignProf()`, `displayStudent()`, `showScore()`, `calculatedResult()` to display the final result.
